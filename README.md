Othello/Reversi

## Game Rules

Othello (also known as Reversi) is a strategic board game played on an 8Ã—8 grid. The game pieces are discs colored black on one side and white on the other.

### Basic Rules:
- Players take turns placing discs on the board with their assigned color facing up
- To make a valid move, a player must place a disc such that it "outflanks" at least one of the opponent's discs
- Outflanking means placing a disc so that an opponent's disc or row of discs is bordered at each end by a disc of the player's color
- All outflanked discs are then flipped to the current player's color
- If a player cannot make a valid move, their turn is skipped
- The game ends when neither player can make a valid move
- The player with the most discs of their color on the board wins
